# Netflix EDA with Pandas

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix data using Pandas. The analysis is aimed at exploring various aspects of the Netflix dataset to gain insights into its content and trends.

## Overview

The main focus of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about Netflix titles, including details such as title name, release year, director, cast, ratings, and more. By using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, we aim to investigate patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

## Contents
